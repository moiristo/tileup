# Tile Up

*Tile Up* is a ruby Ruby gem that splits a large image into a set of tiles to use with javascript mapping libraries such as [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com) or [Modest Maps](http://modestmaps.com/). You can also use *Tile Up* to make tiles for `CATiledLayer` (or anything else really...).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/moiristo/tileup.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/moiristo/tileup)

*Note* This is not the official version of tileup. Since the official version was poorly maintained, I decided to create my own version instead.

## Installation

* Manual:
  * `gem install moiristo-tileup`
* Gemfile:
  * `gem 'moiristo-tileup', require: 'tileup'`

`tileup` requires `rmagick` or `mini_magick` for image manipulation, which depends on `imagemagick`. `imagemagick` is available through `homebrew`.

## Usage

### Basics

To generate some tiles from a large image, you'll probably use something like:

```
tileup --in huge_image.png --output-dir image_tiles \
        --prefix my_tiles --verbose
```

Which will split `huge_image.png` up into `256x256` (default) sized tiles, and save them into the directory `image_tiles`. The images will be saved as `my_tiles_[COLUMN]_[ROW].png`

```
image_tiles/my_tiles_0_0.png
image_tiles/my_tiles_0_1.png
image_tiles/my_tiles_0_2.png
...
```

### Using `Tiler` directly

You can also call `Tiler` directly from your application code:

```
  tiler = TileUp::Tiler.new('huge_image.png', output_dir: 'image_tiles', processor: 'mini_magick', auto_zoom_level: 'auto', logger: 'none')

  # Metadata
  tiler.recommended_auto_zoom_level # Yields the recommended zoom level
  tiler.image_processor.width(tiler.image) # Get the image width of 'huge_image.png' using the specified image processor
  tiler.image_processor.height(tiler.image) # Get the image height of 'huge_image.png' using the specified image processor

  # Tile generation
  tiler.make_tiles!
```

### Auto zooming

`tileup` can also scale your image for a number of zoom levels (max 20 levels). This is done by *scaling down* the original image, so make sure it's pretty big.

```
tileup --in really_huge_image.png --auto-zoom auto \
       --output-dir map_tiles
```

`--auto-zoom auto` means that `tileup` will automatically try to determine the best auto zoom level. The level will be based on the image size and the tile dimensions specified.

```
tileup --in really_huge_image.png --auto-zoom 4 \
       --output-dir map_tiles
```

`--auto-zoom 4` means, make 4 levels of zoom, starting from `really_huge_image.png` at zoom level 20, then scale that down for 19, etc.

You should see something like:

```
map_tiles/20/map_tile_0_0.png
map_tiles/20/map_tile_0_1.png
map_tiles/20/map_tile_0_2.png
...
map_tiles/19/map_tile_0_0.png
map_tiles/19/map_tile_0_1.png
map_tiles/19/map_tile_0_2.png
...
```
*(where `20` is zoom level 20, the largest zoom, `19` is half the size of `20`, `18` is half the size of `19`, â€¦)*
